Every generation, voices shape our perspective. Each day, more children are born, open and excited for the world they will inhabit. Our current state of chaos in the world is the crashing of a tide of awareness across the bow of the authoritarian equivalents of the past. 

# The Tidal Wave Started 50 Years Ago
For the past century since the onset of World War I, our collective consciousness has shifted dramatically towards equality and equal opportunity as a cultural, rather than economic spirit. 

With the current state of democratic governments and their economies, it is clear that an alternative is desired by the populace. It's just a matter of time before the people spending the money figure that out. 

# Blockchain is our Engine for Change
Since Bitcoin's debut in 2008, we've seen an explosion of research spending on topics like consensus algorithms, peer-to-peer finance, and other decentralized systems. Even with this technology in it's infancy, we've already seen invigorated and widespread cultural adoption. From the moment someone encounters the concept of decentralized finance, they begin a years-long journey as they transition to a new framework of social and economic interfaces. 

It can be hard to notice at first, but authoritarian mindsets are laced into everything we know. Our entire social framework as a species has until now, mostly, been curated by a prescribed few who have worked hard to ensure that their prejudice lives on well beyond it's normal lifetime. In the same way that a farmer wishes their family to till the land after their death, our ideological forefathers sought to cement permenantly their own authority as the creators of social order and the innovators of all technology. 

*It is simply not true that any class is responsible for our communal survival.*

# How We're Helping
The GoldFish archive has been designed to provide a common record, abstract, and accurate, of the goings-on of humanity as documented by our online presence. In the same way that jet-trails in the sky signify progress and global connectivity, our mission is to envelop human life in a simple, common system which allows us to ensure that the records have as little bias as possible.

## Our Values
We want to create an honest internet by incentivising our community to help us keep track of what matters most.

### Open 
A system with no owner falls forever into disrepair, but a system with no champions has no will to survive. Our initial network will be governed by a mix of journalists, academics, our own users, and our investors. From this point, we will open participation to anyone who is interested, and we will ensure freedom of publicaton and perspective.

### Transparent
The only way that an archive of human knowledge can exist is if it's public data. Most of the internet archives in 2020 remain closed doors, disconnected from the average person our our general information systems. We hope to change that, by providing incentives to collaborate and preserve our most treasured resource.

### Incentivised
Our society is well-past the days of civil rights marches and personal sacrifice. It is our mission to build a system that is not only accountable, but also ensures the economic well-being of it's stewards. Each of us has a role to play in the information economy, and it is our mission to ensure that contributions are reliably measured and that compensation is issued not once, but over the entire lifetime of the system, even if it outlasts it's contributors.

# Want to be part of the revolution?
We're working to ensure everyone can participate, and everyone can be rewarded. Our upcoming mobile app will allow anyone to participate in the data-gathering economy, and even vote to govern it's evolution over time. The first step? Easy - follow us on social media, join our newsletter, and tell a friend. If everyone does, the revolution will be over before it even begins. 

Let's leave the Kings in the past, where they belong. 

Long live the Humans.
