# What's a KOI?
Starting next month, 1000.0000000000 KOI will be generated and given to whomever is the contributor of the content which receives the most attention on the Arweave's Permaweb.

As more and more people earn KOI for contributing, we will also expand the ability to request verifiable tasks related to the content of this archive, thereby creating an interwoven incentive mechanism to support longterm growth. 

*The KOI Profit Sharing Community will act as an incentive mechanism to reward contributions to the Arweave.*

# The First Three
The first three ways that a user can earn extra _*bounty*_ tokens will be built as a part of the core product offerring, allowing immediate utility of the token, and providing an example for future development.

## Public Surveys
A crucial part of modern democracy is polling and census data. The KOI protocol allows anyone to verify their identity and begin answering polling questions. The result will be written on the permaweb for all to see, and can serve not only as an anthropoligical tool, but simultaneously a voting mechanism for a wide range of subjects, ideas, or debates.

## GET, Store, Catalogue
The existing internet already contains a wide range of subject-matter, reference material, and historical records. The process of retrieving this information, uploading it to the permaweb, and then cataloguing and tagging it's contents will immediately provide value, and any party seeking to gather existing web data can utilize this decentralized commons to economically and efficiently gather data.

## Indexing And Staking
The value of taste in good information cannot be understated. As personal and decentralized search agents gain popularity (i.e. The Graph, Fetch.ai, or PUBLC) it is becoming clear that there will soon be a market for a reliable map of the web, and that it will likely be a public good. KOI tasks can be set to incentivize community members to crawl a domain and map or map the structure of an API for future tasks to consume.

*All data gathered by the KOI Network will be stored on the permaweb forever, ensuring that future generations have an accurate rearview mirror.*

# The KOI Profit-Sharing Community
Arweave's native contract language ("Smartweave") is executed asynchronously by the user, and the results are then stored at a very small cost to the Arweave Because of this, the throughput of the network is limited by the number of users, rather than the number of mining nodes, or their individual capacity.

## Participants
The KOI token marketplace will exist as a single contract within this ecosystem, and will enable the interactions of human and machine agents completing KOI Archival tasks. 

### Human Agents
The first and most important element of the KOI network is the ability for anyone to set up a wallet, at no cost to themselves, and begin earning KOI tokens. Human feedback is the most valuable commodity in the world, and KOI will provide straightforward platforms for participants to engage and be fairly rewarded.

### Machine Agents
Some tasks are either too tedious or too complex to be done manually. In these cases, we allow KOI holders to stake their tokens and run an automated strategy. In these cases, the machine agent is held to the same standard as a human agent would be, but may require a larger stake to operate.

## Identifying Malicious Behaviour
Because the Arweave is permenantly visible to all parties, the result of a given survey or data gathering excercise can be calculated and cached by each party independantly. As a result, if bad actors are identified, even many years later, the record can be corrected almost immediately to remove their misdirection. 

*_This cannot, of course, remove the second order effects such as the momentum of an election, or other more complex systems, so some activities may choose to require participants to stake for a longer period, or verify some kind of personal credential or offline verification process._*

# The KOI Protocol
The core protocol of the KOI network brings these parts together to form a decentralized marketplace where task completion can be directly verified by the existence of data on the permanent record. 

## Game Model
1. Participants add data to the Arweave Permaweb, and receive in return for their contribution a profit-sharing token. This non-fungible ownership share entitles them to a *"ticket"* each time that the content it represents is read by a user of the permaweb, even if in aggregate. 

2. Every 24 hours, one participant can trigger a function to release the daily 1000 KOI tokens as 'Attention Rewards'. The tokens are then distributed to the participants that uploaded them, and those parties are free to spend them as a task-reward within the system.

_Note:_ While 1000 KOI per day may seem like a substantial amount (or highly inflationary) is less than half of the number of Bitcoin per day (~1800) or the number of Ethereum per day (~14000), and requires useful proof of work, in the form of consumed energy to retrieve the data from the internet, as well as the cost of adding it to the permaweb. 

## Verifiable Tasking
As well as the core function of rewarding attention within the Arweave network, KOI will also serve as an added incentive since it can be used as a bounty to request certain type of content be added to the chain. When a bounty is set, the payer can also provide rules of the game, which can detail complex engagements that result in adding content to the permaweb, such as those listed above. 

# Get Involved
We, together with the Arweave network, are building the library of the future, and it is completely open to anyone who wants to help. No longer will power or censorship dominate the pages of history, but it's up to each of us to help in this process. We are also working on building tools to make it easier to browse this permanent archive, and would love to have your help, if you're up to the challenge.
