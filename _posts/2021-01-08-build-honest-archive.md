<h1>KOI: Knowledgeable Open Internet</h1>

It's rare to find an altruistic developer community that's in its infancy and happens to be well-funded.  Welcome to KOI.

<h2>What Fuels Us</h2>
KOI directly translates to "Knowledgeable Open Internet". The mission is to incentivize miners such that they retrieve honest curated content to be stored in a decentralized database such as Arweave.  We have come a long way from a simple web-scraping app. The KOI ecosystem now combines a web app, desktop app, data mining scripts, Ethereum smart contracts, KOI coin minting, a data marketplace, and a distributed database in pursuit of our vision. We are helping build a permanently open internet for future generations through the layering of human knowledge.

We are looking for enthusiastic and determined devs to join us. We are acquiring additional venture funding by the day.

<h2>Tech stack (hyper-modern)</h2>
  - Back-End:
    Express web server connected to an AWS hosted MySql database
  - Front-End:
    Electron-wrapped React desktop app and a React-powered web app
  - Block chain development:
    Utilize Arweave's Smartweave contracts to facilitate Koi token exchange
  - Mining scripts:
    Web crawling logic and connectors to Arweave database

If this distributed software ecosystem excites you, join our Discord community. We talk about all things from tech to tea.

If you hang around the Discord and resonate with the mission, we'll invite you to the GitHub repo, which is where the real fun begins. Since we're going through funding rounds, it's important to keep our repos private, but they will be truly open source over time and managed by a Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO).  KOI has no interest in a single governing body.  Everyone in the DAO will be heard!

Feel free to poke around the web app and experience a small taste of our built-out web scraping capabilities: <https://goldfishservice.xyz/>

<h2>KOI's Mission</h2>
  - Create a platform for scraping the entire web and storing the truthful, indexed, and curated content as the next libary of human knowledge. This is more important than ever as centralized entities move to reshape the internet in their own image.
  - Create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)
    - The Koi network will run as a DAO, which is to say that it will be led in a p2p manner.  Token holders can use their KOI to cast votes to determine the type of content to scrape and any other issues that require decision making.  We're all in this together!
  - Acquire funding through Outlier Ventures Basecamp Accelerator program
    - As mentioned, Koi is in the initial stages of funding via investors from Outlier Ventures.  You have the opportunity to get in early and build out features that can make Koi even more appealing at such a crucial moment.  If you've heard of crypto-whales, they're actually a real thing, and we'll be talking to them daily for the next five months within the accelerator.  There are billions of dollars on the table if we do this right.
  - Work with creative, passionate people
  - If this sounds exciting, important, and fun, then you are in the right place.

  <h2>KOI Network Sustainable Incentives</h2>
  - Koi tokens will be distributed every few minutes as new blocks are created.  The tokens will be distributed proportionally to the miners who are archiving the most valid and highly trafficed URL's.  Since the number of tokens mined per block time will stay constant even as the number of miners increase, the KOI token will remain a deflationary currency and hence increase in value.  Tokenomics is fun!
  - Clients can add bounties to a web page to have it's contents scraped and validated for consistency by every node running the desktop app.  The node who submits the winning payload wins the bounty and is paid in Koi tokens, which are held in a smart contract on the Ethereum mainnet.  The value of KOI will increase as clients take advantage of our web scraping service by staking Koi to have web pages scraped.
  - Content validation nodes will earn KOI just by keeping the desktop app running in the background and processing the bounty URL queue.
  - Interested parties can exchange tokens for archived structured JSON data sets collected from our web scraping efforts via the Ocean data marketplace exchange.

- Dev Compensation
  - Closing out issues in GitHub will directly translate into Koi tokens being deposited to your crypto-wallet.  As we build more apps that use KOI as the medium for exchange of services, the value of the token will grow.  Then, we can attract more investors with further rounds of funding.  It's a beautiful cycle that relies on us building out really neat yet uber useful functionality.
