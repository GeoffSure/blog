### Proof of Principle
Koi is a project in early infancy, but that has not prevented it from changing shape many times over as the team pushes for strategic capital, alignment with ecosystem partners, addresses shifting dynamics in the blockchain space, and develops the Koi protocol testnet .

We are excited that the effects of time, community influence, and priority shifts have not forced us to rethink the foundational ideals and use case potential which originally informed the creation of Koi. Change aside, Koi is a principled project that has not shifted course in the big picture. 

Protocol iterations, ecosystem growth, and new ideas about what Koi can or should do (as expressed by our community and team) have consistently converged to align with Koi’s principles. We see this convergence as validation that the ideals and assumptions which prompted the initial creation of Koi are both universally understood, and practical. 

### Next Steps
With our principles validated, It’s time to make sure our growing community fully understands them. We aim to cultivate a community in which members maintain a strong sense of why they are here, and what they would like to do.

To begin this process, we will begin releasing informative materials in the form of frequently asked questions on our website, our blog, and our community discord channel. Each FAQ will represent specific parts of the Koi project. There are many components to Koi and the ecosystem growing around it, so a logical organization of the information is key to fully understanding the project. 

Our first FAQ will cover the foundational principles of Koi. From there we will build up to other topics. Onward.
