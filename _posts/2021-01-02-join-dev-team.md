Welcome to an open source community who's scraping the web for good using a modern tech stack in a decentralized, truth-seeking fashion.

<h1>Found your tribe</h1>

<h1>KOI: Knowledgeable Open Internet</h1>
I'm sure you've read in Medium posts that contributing to an open source community is a great way to grow as a developer and do something meaningful with your time.  You may have then felt inspired to poke around GitHub for a community to join.  After ~20 minutes of indecision, itâ€™s easy to just go back to working on a project for your 9-5, read a Medium post, or start an online course to learn a crunchy new software skill.

But doesn't a part of you wish that you would have found a passion project that checks all the boxes on the list of what makes contribution worthwhile:
- Tech stack (hyper-modern):
  - Back-End: Express web server connected to an AWS hosted MySql database
  - Front-End: Electron-wrapped React desktop app and a React-powered web app
- Missions
  - Scrape the web and validate truthfulness of the content over time by archiving a structured JSON representation of the page in a queue.  This is more important than ever in the age of fake news!
  - Clients can add bounties to a web page to have it's contents scraped and validated for consistency by every node running the desktop app.  The node who submits the winning payload wins the bounty and is paid in Koi tokens, which are held in a smart contract in the Ethereum mainnet.
  - Create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)
    - The Koi network will run as a DAO, which is to say that it will be led in a p2p manner.  Token holders can use their KOI to cast votes to determine the type of content to scrape and any other issues that require decision making.  We're all in this together!
  - Acquire funding through Outlier Ventures Basecamp Accelerator program
    - Koi is in the initial stages of funding via investors from Outlier Ventures.  You have the opportunity to get in early and build out features that can make Koi even more appealing at such a crucial moment in our short history.  If you've heard of crypto-whales, they're actually a real thing, and we'll be talking to them daily for the next five months within the accelerator.  There's literally billions of dollars on the table if we do this right.  It's really exciting tbh.
- Work with creative, passionate people
  - If this interests you, you're in the right place.  Join our Discord channel and get a feel for our vibe!
- Compensation
  - Closing out issues in GitHub will directly translate into Koi tokens being deposited to your crypto-wallet.  The value of Koi will increase as clients take advantage of our web scraping service by staking Koi to have web pages scraped.  They can also exchange tokens for archived structured JSON data sets collected from our web scraping efforts. As we build more apps that use Koi as the medium for exchange of services, the value of the token will grow.  Then, we can attract more investors with further rounds of funding.  It's a beautiful cycle that relies on us building out really neat yet uber useful functionality.
