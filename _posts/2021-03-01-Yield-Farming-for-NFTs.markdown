# New Revenue Streams
Open Koi provides NFTs with new income streams while expanding and optimizing NFT capabilities via “Koi Assets”. 

## Moving Beyond ERC-721
The accessibility of the ERC-721 standard has led to an explosion of digital art, but as we’ve discussed in a previous blog, this is imperfect. Currently, a small number of marketplaces house the majority of these NFTs, mostly as ERC-721 contracts.

## Atomic NFTs
The launch of the Atomic NFT standard on the Arweave allows for digital creators to mint permanent assets that provide attention-based income streams in the form of $KOI rewards. Not only does this standard provide creators with new opportunities to earn a “yield” on their NFT, but it closes the loop on digital creation. 

# Earn Rewards
By registering their NFTs on the Arweave with Koi, collectors and creators will be able to earn a secondary revenue stream in the form of attention rewards, and ensure long term preservation of their assets with implicit permanence. 

## Reducing Waste
Creators can upload their creations directly to the permaweb as Koi assets, or transfer their ERC-721 NFTs to the Koi NFT portal. This means that ERC-721 NFTs can now earn passive dividends forever, just by being displayed in a Koi-compatible gallery. NFTs can also be minted directly to the permaweb via the Koi network, bypassing the need for the Ethereum blockchain and wasteful gas cost.
