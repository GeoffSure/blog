# Free KOI, coming right up! A KOI faucet tutorial

If you already have an [Arweave Wallet](https://blog.openkoi.com/An-Arweave-faucet-tutorial/), you’re in the right place to grab some free KOI. If you don’t have an Arweave-compatible wallet yet, head on over to our Faucet. If you already have KOI, you can skip ahead to the [upload process](https://koi.rocks/register-content).

[Click here to go to the KOI faucet.](https://koi.rocks/faucet?step=0)

You already have an Arweave wallet, so click “Skip ahead” on step 1.

Then you’ll drag your new wallet keyfile onto the dashed rectangle. You can drag it directly from the Finder or File Explorer, then click “Submit.”

After we submit the keyfile, we must do a Twitter verification process (Just like we did in the Arweave Wallet tutorial) so Koi can make sure we are not a bot.  Unfortunately, we can’t verify for both AR and KOI with the same tweet.
Next, click “Tweet to Verify.” A Twitter popup will appear, click “Tweet” to confirm. You will likely be logged in already from the previous Twitter confirmation.

After tweeting, click “Get KOI.” You will receive 5 free KOI and be able to upload 5 NFTs onto the Koi Portal. Be sure to sign up to recieve our [newsletter](https://openkoi.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=d90823177f316ca38afbc6c61&id=b69c610637) where your NFT could be featured and start earning KOI whenever your content is veiwed!
