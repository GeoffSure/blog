# Free KOI, coming right up! A KOI faucet tutorial

If you already have an Arweave Wallet, you’re in the right place to grab some free KOI. If you don’t have an Arweave-compatible wallet yet, head on over to our Faucet. If you already have KOI, you can skip ahead to the [upload process](https://koi.rocks/register-content).
Go to the KOI faucet.

You already have an Arweave wallet so click “Skip ahead” on step 1.

Then you’ll drag your new wallet keyfile onto the dashed rectangle. You can drag it directly from the Finder or File Explorer. Then click “Submit.”

After we submit the keyfile, we do the same Twitter verification process for Koi to make sure you’re not a bot.  Unfortunately, we can’t verify for both AR and KOI with the same tweet.
Next, click “Tweet to Verify.” A Twitter popup will appear, click “Tweet” to confirm. You will likely be logged in already from the previous Twitter confirmation.
