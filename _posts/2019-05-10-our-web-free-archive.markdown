A <a href="#" class="">recent McKinsey poll</a> found that 60% of white collar roles contain tasks that can be at least partially automated. On the bright side, they also note that most roles still require a fully-thinking person, and cannot yet be managed by any robot. 

<h5>So- automate your own tasks and relax!</h5>

<h3>Seriously - it's that easy</h3>
If you have any tasks that require you to check one website and report a value, or better yet, if you have 100 webpages with 100 values, <a href="https://goldfishservice.xyz">Goldfish</a> can help. 

Our single page app lets you quickly configure a service that checks the page, and then puts the data wherever you need it to go. Currently they support SMS, Email, Public URL, IFTTT, and more!

<h3>Our Vision</h3>
We want to make it easy for everyone to access information and make decisions. As we grow, we are dedicating 10% of all proceeds towards our free Web Archive project. This tool will allow our customers to store versions of a web page for public use, to ensure free and equal access to information. 

When you share your scraped data feeds with the public archive, you'll even able to earn rewards, and get more scraping for free in the future.

<h1>We don't want to become big tech<h1>
We aren't in this to become Big Brother- in fact, we're working on building a decentralized governance model for the Golfish network, which will ensure fair and equitable access to market data for anyone who needs it. 

Furthermore, we believe that through public recording of site data, we can also ensure journalistic integrity, and even help to correct corruption wherever it begins to grow.
