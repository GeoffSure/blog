We've been really happy to hear how much time people are saving with Goldfish scrapers. We want to take it a step further!

<h3>Saving Resources</h3>
We don't think of ourselves as environmentalists, but we're definitely into efficiency. With that in mind, we're soon going to be offering users the ability to share their scraped data on an open archive. 

<i><b>Note:</b> You can set a delay if you don't want to the data to go public immediately!</i>

<h3>How it works</h3>
We're still working out all the kinks, but the general idea is that for every other user that views data you scraped, we'll pay you. Rewards may come in the form of account credits, cryptocurrency tokens, or even more cool options. We'll publish more information soon!

<h3>Our Vision</h3>
We want to make it easy for everyone to access information and make decisions. As we grow, we are dedicating 10% of all proceeds towards our free Web Archive project. This tool will allow our customers to store versions of a web page for public use, to ensure free and equal access to information. 

When you share your scraped data feeds with the public archive, you'll even able to earn rewards, and get more scraping for free in the future.

<h1>We don't want to become big tech</h1>
We aren't in this to become Big Brother- in fact, we're working on building a decentralized governance model for the Golfish network, which will ensure fair and equitable access to market data for anyone who needs it. 

Furthermore, we believe that through public recording of site data, we can also ensure journalistic integrity, and even help to correct corruption wherever it begins to grow.
