# What's a KOI?
We are building a highly divisible currency which is generated and given to whomever produces the contributor of the content which receives the most attention on the Arweave's Permaweb.

As more and more people earn KOI for contributing, we will also expand the ability to request verifiable tasks related to the content of this archive, thereby creating an interwoven incentive mechanism to support longterm growth. 

# Three Use Cases 
The first three ways that a user can earn extra _*bounty*_ tokens will be built as a part of the core product offerring, allowing immediate utility of the token, and providing an example for future development.

## Public Surveys
A crucial part of modern democracy is polling and census data. The KOI protocol allows anyone to verify their identity and begin answering polling questions. The result will be written on the permaweb for all to see, and can serve not only as an anthropoligical tool, but simultaneously a voting mechanism for a wide range of subjects, ideas, or debates.

## GET, Store, Catalogue
The existing internet already contains a wide range of subject-matter, reference material, and historical records. The process of retrieving this information, uploading it to the permaweb, and then cataloguing and tagging it's contents will immediately provide value, and any party seeking to gather existing web data can utilize this decentralized commons to economically and efficiently gather data.

## Indexing And Staking
The value of taste in good information cannot be understated. As personal and decentralized search agents gain popularity (i.e. The Graph, Fetch.ai, or PUBLC) it is becoming clear that there will soon be a market for a reliable map of the web, and that it will likely be a public good. KOI tasks can be set to incentivize community members to crawl a domain and map or map the structure of an API for future tasks to consume.

*All data gathered by the KOI Network will be stored on the permaweb forever, ensuring that future generations have an accurate rearview mirror.*

# SmartWeave
Arweave's native contract language supports asynchronous execution and the throughput of the network is limited by the number of users, rather than the number of mining nodes, or their individual capacity.

The KOI token marketplace will exist as a single contract within this ecosystem, and will enable the interactions of human and machine agents completing KOI Archival tasks.
